# Testnet

By default, **bitgo** will use the production Bitcoin network, and will authenticate
with **www.bitgo.com**. In order to use BitGo's test environment at **test.bitgo.com**, either use **-e test** on the command line, or set the following environment variable:
```
$ export BITGO_ENV=test
```
The testnet environment is a completely separate namespace from the BitGo production database. You will need to set up separate accounts on [test.bitgo.com](https://test.bitgo.com/) for testing purposes.  Note that in the test environment, while standard Authy codes still work for 2FA, it is also possible to use a code of 0000000 (7 zeroes).

# Sessions

The tool maintains one current login session per environment (prod or test). The sessions are persisted in JSON format files in **~/.bitgo**.  Each session maintains the user's current auth token, and maintains a current wallet. All of the commands that operate on a wallet use this current wallet context. In order to operate on a different wallet, it must first be selected using the **wallet** command.

# Output formats

A number of the commands support outputting in JSON format as well as the normal human-readable format. To enable JSON output, use the **-j** command
line flag **before** the command, for example:

```
$ bitgo -j status
{
  "env": "test",
  "network": "testnet",
  "sessionFile": "/Users/me/.bitgo/test.json",
  "user": "me@me.com",
  "wallet": "2N6d5SYvu1xQeSQnpZ4VNVZ6TcRYcqkocao"
}
```

# Commands

### A Note on Command-Line Options
Many of the commands have interactive flows, prompting for needed information as they go. Generally, these interactive prompts can be bypassed by providing the corresponding information through a command-line flag.

## login
Authenticate with BitGo, establishing a session.
```
$ bitgo login
Email: user@domain.com
Password: ********
2-Step Verification Code: 0000000
*** Logged in as user@domain.com
...
```

## logout
Logout of the current session. Sessions expire in 60 minutes by default.
```
$ bitgo logout
```

## token
Show the current auth token:
```
$ bitgo token
bab7b73dec9501b8b210ec8d68e1ac26a88b7b8c3c4f6811935d793d627c7d54
```
Set the current auth token; this is an alternate way of changing sessions, or can be used to install a long-lived API token provided by BitGo:
```
$ bitgo token 24b7b73dec9501b8b210ec8d68e1ac26a88b7b8c3c4f6811935d793d627c7d54
*** Logged in as user@domain.com
```

## status
Show the current session status.
```
$ bitgo status
Network: prod
Session file: ~/.bitgo/prod.json
Current User: user@domain.com
Logged in
Current wallet: 3N6d5SYvu1xQeSQnpZ4VNVZ6TcRYcqkocao
```

## wallets
List the wallets available to the user, with balances. Indicates which wallet is currently selected.
```
$ bitgo wallets
```

## wallet
Get or set the current wallet.
```
$ bitgo wallet          # shows current wallet information
$ bitgo wallet 3        # selects wallet 3 in the wallets list
$ bitgo wallet <addr>   # selects wallet by address
$ bitgo wallet <name>   # selects wallet by name
```

## balance
Get the balance of the current wallet.
```
$ bitgo balance         # get balance in BTC
$ bitgo balance -c      # get confirmed balance in BTC
$ bitgo balance -u bits # get balance in bits
$ bitgo balance -u sat  # get balance in satoshis
```

## labels
Show address labels associated with the current wallet, or all wallets.
```
$ bitgo labels        # shows address labels on current wallet
$ bitgo labels -a     # shows address labels on all wallets
```

## setlabel
Label a Bitcoin address in the context of the current wallet.
```
$ bitgo setlabel <address> "My label here"
```

## removelabel
Remove label from a Bitcoin address in the context of the current wallet.
```
$ bitgo removelabel <address>
```

## addresses
Show receive addresses for the current wallet, and optionally change addresses. Shows
```
$ bitgo addresses           # show receive addresses only
$ bitgo addresses -c        # include change addresses
$ bitgo -j addresses        # show addresses in JSON format
```

## newaddress
Generate a new receive address for the current wallet
```
$ bitgo newaddress          # get a new receive address
$ bitgo newaddress -c       # get a new change <address>
$ bitgo newaddress -l "foo" # get a new receive address labeled "foo"
```
## tx
List transactions on the current wallet.
```
$ bitgo tx                  # show last 25 transactions
$ bitgo tx -n 100           # show last 100 transactions
$ bitgo -j tx               # show last 25 transactions in JSON format
```

## unlock
In order to transact, a BitGo session must first be unlocked, by providing an additional
2-step verification (Authy) code. The **send** command handles prompting for this automatically, but the
wallet can also be unlocked explicitly.
```
$ bitgo unlock 1234567     # unlock the session with current Authy code
*** Unlocked session
```

## lock
Explicitly lock the session, preventing further transactions from taking place.
```
$ bitgo lock
*** Locked session
```
## sharewallet
Share the current wallet with a user by giving them share, spend, or admin priviliges on the wallet. If no
wallet is specified, it will use the current wallet. You must have admin status on the wallet to use this command.
```
$ bitgo sharewallet 2N6d5SYvu1xQeSQnpZ4VNVZ6TcRYcqkocao
Share Wallet 2N6d5SYvu1xQeSQnpZ4VNVZ6TcRYcqkocao:

Email address of recipient: user@domain.com
Role ( [a]dmin | [s]pender | [v]iewer ): s
Optional comment for recipient: Spend limit is 100 BTC
Wallet password: *******
2-step Verification Code: 0000000
*** Wallet share created (id=55cd2f4cf1f414280c2c926af4c47874)
```

## shares
Lists outstanding wallet shares (incoming and outgoing)

```
$ bitgo shares

Outgoing Shares:
  ID                                Role     To                  Wallet              Message
  55cd2f4cf1f414280c2c926af4c47874  spender   user@domain.com       0                   Spend limit is 100 BTC

## cancelshare
Cancel or decline a wallet share invite

```
$ bitgo cancelshare 47874c4fa629c2c082414f1fc4f2dc55
*** Wallet share canceled
```

## freezewallet
Freeze a BitGo wallet. This command effectively time-locks a wallet, so that BitGo will refuse to sign any transactions until the freeze
expires. Be careful when freezing a wallet, as there is no way to unfreeze a wallet without either waiting for the time to expire without
help from BitGo support.

```
$ bitgo freezewallet -d 60
Please confirm you wish to freeze wallet 'My Wallet' for 60 seconds.
BitGo will not sign any transactions on this wallet until the freeze expires.
Type 'go' to confirm: go
Wallet frozen until 2015-02-03T22:46:56.352Z
```

## removewallet
Remove a wallet from your BitGo account. If the wallet is shared, and you are not the last admin, it removes your access to
the wallet but does not affect other users' access. If you are the last admin on the wallet, it will mark the wallet as deleted
and it will not currently be recoverable without assistance from BitGo.

```
$ bitgo removewallet 2MzoQpTopwMD7dfufGeHHvZYfEDrMdxibTM
Type 'yes' to confirm removing wallet 2MzoQpTopwMD7dfufGeHHvZYfEDrMdxibTM: yes
*** Removed wallet 2MzoQpTopwMD7dfufGeHHvZYfEDrMdxibTM
```

## unspents
Show a list of unspents on the current wallet, optionally filtering by minimum confirms.
```
$ bitgo unspents            # show all unspents
$ bitgo unspents -c 6       # show unspents with at least 6 confirms
```

## unspent
Same command as above

## consolidate
Consolidate the unspents on the current wallet into fewer, bigger unspents, optionally setting the target count of unspents.
```
$ bitgo consolidate         # consolidate all unspents into one
$ bitgo consolidate -t 5    # consolidate all unspents until there are only five unspents left
$ bitgo consolidate -i 10   # consolidate all unspents into one, but only use up to 10 inputs per consolidation transaction
```

## fanout
Fan out the unspents on the current wallet into a set of more, equally large, unspents.
```
$ bitgo fanout -t 20        # fan out all the unspents into a total of 20 unspents
```

## sendtoaddress
Send a transaction. This command provides a guided flow, but the needed info may also be provided on the command line.
```
$ bitgo -e test send

```

## newkey
Create a new BIP32 root key. This is a client-side only operation. It does not require the user to be authenticated with BitGo, and does not contact the BitGo server.  Additional entropy may be provided on the command line.
```
$ bitgo -j newkey
{
  "seed": "72cc2a8728529c17432031ca5a37851b9dfe254f5427f7ebedb6c15abac22575",

}
```

## splitkeys
This is a client-side utility command which assists in generating a batch of BIP32 keys which are split
using Shamir Secret Sharing, and have the shares encrypted with separate passwords (each
known by a separate person, generally).  It provides a guided flow, as well as command-line args.

```

## newwallet
Create a new BitGo HD 2-of-3 Multi-sig wallet. This is a guided flow with instructions. You will need to provide 1 xprv and 1 xpub, or 2 xpubs in order to create the wallet.

**Please be aware that creating a wallet in this manner does not produce a recovery KeyCard. You are fully responsible for backing up your keys. If you lose access to your keys and passcode, BitGo cannot help you recover your funds.**

```
$ bitgo newwallet
Current User: ben+0@bitgo.com
Create New Wallet undefined

First, we need the user keychain. Enter a BIP32 xprv below, or press
return to generate one automatically. Your user key is encrypted locally
with your password, and stored on BitGo's server.

User key (xprv or xpub): xprv9s21ZrQH143K4VhG7qJD...

Next, we need the backup keychain. Enter a BIP32 xpub below. It is recommended
to generate the backup keychain on a different machine using reliable
BIP32 key generation software. For instance, you can use the 'keychain'
sub-command to generate a keychain

Backup key (xpub): xpub661MyMwAqRbcG7xHfBQqNLMNS...
